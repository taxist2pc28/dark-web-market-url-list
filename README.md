### 1. We The North Market – By a Sceptic Turned Believer

I’ve seen dozens of markets come and go, with exit scams and shutdowns happening all the time. Honestly, I didn’t expect much from any new platform. But after many months watching chatter on forums and actually using it myself, **We The North Market** has stood out as the most trusted Canadian-focused option to date. Strict admin oversight, genuine vendor reviews, and a robust escrow system are just the start. The admin bans sales of weapons and anything related to terrorism. They’ve even got a user forum and a clear ban on external contact info for vendors, which helps prevent scams.

### 2. Nexus Market – By a Veteran Vendor

After running a vendor account on nearly every major marketplace since Dream and AlphaBay, I know what real professionalism looks like. Nexus is the only one that matches We The North for uptime, consistent support, and scam protections. Fast deposits and withdrawals, strong escrow, and a transparent dispute resolution system set Nexus apart. More importantly, it’s not overloaded by international spam or fly-by-night sellers. Nexus has cultivated a real community, and buyers keep coming back.
